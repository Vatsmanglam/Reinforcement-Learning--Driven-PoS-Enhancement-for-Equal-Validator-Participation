**Results**


Our Project applied reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in blockchain networks. We focused on enhancing the selection of validators
based on key performance metrics: transaction throughput, confirmation latency, network stability, and validator efficiency. By using RL, the system learned to adapt to dynamic network conditions and identify optimal validator choices, leading to significant improvements in overall network performance.


Through extensive simulations and experiments, we observed notable advancements in the defined metrics. Transaction throughput increased, demonstrating more efficient utilization of network resources. Confirmation latency was reduced, resulting in faster transaction finality. The optimized validator selection also enhanced network stability, making the blockchain more resilient to disruptions. Additionally, we noted improved validator efficiency, contributing to lower energy consumption and operational costs.
