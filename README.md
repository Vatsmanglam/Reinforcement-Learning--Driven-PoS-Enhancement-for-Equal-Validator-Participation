# Reinforcement-Learning--Driven-PoS-Enhancement-for-Equal-Validator-Participation
Enhancing Scalability of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain Consensus mechanism by improving Validator selection Based on performance metrics using Reinforcement Learning Model.


**Objectives**

• Develop a machine learning-based approach for analyzing historical network data and predicting optimal validator selections.

• Investigate innovative approaches to validator selection in PoS networks, addressing challenges such as randomness, fairness, decentralization to optimize consensus efficiency and scalability.

• Use reinforcement learning to adjust validator selection criteria based on performance metric.

• Provide insights into the scalability challenges of PoS blockchain networks and efficient consensus mechanisms through innovative approaches to validator selection and machine learning.
